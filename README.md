# ***Blinkit_Data-Analysis***

## Introduction :  
The Blinkit Data Analysis project leverages the power of Power BI to enhance business decision-making. By focusing on critical areas such as sales performance, customer behavior, inventory management, and delivery efficiency, this project aims to provide actionable insights.

Data integration from multiple sources was achieved, and an array of visualizations were utilized to present these insights comprehensively. The data extraction process involved the use of BeautifulSoup, followed by a detailed analysis phase to uncover valuable information and trend

## Method : 
- Initially extracted data using Web Scraping Tool, BeautifulSoup.
- Identified key performance indicators (KPIs), including total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average rating.  
- Connected an Excel sheet containing Blinkit grocery sales data to Power BI.  
- Constructed the dashboard with filters for outlet size, item type, and dates.  
- Created charts to effectively visualize the data.  
- Implemented interactive features to allow for filtering by multiple items and clearing all filters at once.
